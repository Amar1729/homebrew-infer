# Infer: Homebrew Tap

A custom tap for [infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer) since the formula requires some odd things to build.

This formula provides `infer` built with both C/C++ and Java support.

Currently this formula only provides prebuilt bottles for Mojave, so installing on older macOS versions will require building from source.

## Installation
```bash
# install from this tap explicitly, since Homebrew core provides an older infer:
brew install amar1729/infer/infer
```
